## Project Components📁

1. **Database Design and Implementation**🗃️
   - Developed a logical data model representing the key entities and their relationships.
   - Deployed the physical data model in MySQL using the Forward Engineer method in MySQL Workbench.

2. **SQL Queries**💻
   - Created various SQL queries for data management and summarization, including:
     - Creating views for simplified data access
     - Using JOINs to extract comprehensive data from multiple tables
     - Defining stored procedures for booking management

3. **Data Analytics**📈
   - Utilized Tableau for data visualization, creating various charts and dashboards that provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and cuisine performance.

## Little Lemon Data Model🍋

The data model visually represents the entities involved in the Little Lemon database and their relationships. Key components include:

- **Entities**:
  - **Customers**: Information about the restaurant's patrons.
  - **Orders**: Details of customer orders.
  - **Menus**: Items available for order.
  - **MenuItems**: Specific items within each menu.
  - **Bookings**: Reservations made by customers.

### Data Model Characteristics

- **Attributes**: Each entity has defined attributes that describe its properties.
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for each record within a table.
- **Foreign Keys**: References that establish relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity.

## Deploying the Data Model in MySQL🛢️

To deploy the data model in MySQL, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Model**: Open MySQL Workbench and create a new model.
2. **Forward Engineer**: Use the Forward Engineer feature to generate the SQL schema based on the physical data model.
3. **Execute SQL**: Run the generated SQL script in your MySQL server to create the Little Lemon schema.

## 👨🏿‍💻SQL Queries

### Task 1: Create a Virtual Table

To simplify order management, we create a view that focuses on orders with a quantity greater than 2.

```sql
CREATE VIEW OrdersView AS
SELECT OrderID, Quantity, Cost
FROM orders
WHERE Quantity > 2;
```

### Task 2: Extract Customer and Order Information

This query retrieves information about customers with orders exceeding $150, using multiple JOIN clauses to combine data from several tables.

```sql
SELECT customers.CustomerID, customers.FullName, orders.OrderID, orders.Cost, 
       menus.MenuName, menuitems.CourseName
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.CustomerID = orders.CustomerID
INNER JOIN menus ON orders.MenuID = menus.MenuID
INNER JOIN menuitems ON menuitems.MenuItemID = menus.MenuItemsID
WHERE Cost > 150
ORDER BY Cost;

```

### Task 3: Create a Stored Procedure to Get Maximum Quantity

This stored procedure retrieves the maximum quantity ordered in the orders table.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetMaxQuantity()
BEGIN
    SELECT MAX(Quantity) AS "Max Quantity in Order" FROM orders;
END;

```

### Task 4: Booking Procedures

Several stored procedures were created to manage bookings:

`MakeBooking()`
Inserts a new booking into the database.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE MakeBooking(IN booking_id INT, IN customer_id INT, IN table_no INT, IN booking_date DATE)
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO bookings (BookingID, BookingDate, TableNumber, CustomerID)
    VALUES (booking_id, booking_date, table_no, customer_id);
    SELECT "New booking added" AS "Confirmation";
END;

```

`CheckBooking()`
Verifies if a specific table is booked on a given date.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE CheckBooking(IN booking_date DATE, IN table_number INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE bookedTable INT DEFAULT 0;
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO bookedTable
    FROM Bookings
    WHERE BookingDate = booking_date AND TableNumber = table_number;

    IF bookedTable > 0 THEN
        SELECT CONCAT("Table ", table_number, " is already booked") AS "Booking status";
    ELSE
        SELECT CONCAT("Table ", table_number, " is not booked") AS "Booking status";
    END IF;
END;

```

`UpdateBooking()`
Updates an existing booking’s date.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateBooking(IN booking_id INT, IN booking_date DATE)
BEGIN
    UPDATE bookings 
    SET BookingDate = booking_date 
    WHERE BookingID = booking_id;
    SELECT CONCAT("Booking ", booking_id, " updated") AS "Confirmation";
END;

```

**Compared sales data for `Turkish`, `Italian`, and `Greek` cuisines from `2020` to `2022`, illustrating sales and profits.**

### Task 5: Interactive Dashboard
![Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/Willie-Conway/Meta-Database-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Exercises/Create%20interactive%20dashboard%20for%20sales%20and%20profits/Screenshots/Screenshot%202024-09-29%20030356.png)  
**Created an interactive dashboard combining the `bar` and `bubble` charts, allowing users to filter data dynamically.**


## 👨🏿‍💻Client Project Setup with Python

### Setup Steps

### 1. Import MySQL Connector

```sql

import mysql.connector as connector

```

### 2. Connect to the Database

```sql

connection = connector.connect(user="mario", password="cuisine")

```

### 3. Create a Cursor

```sql

cursor = connection.cursor()

```

### 4. Set Database Context

```sql

cursor.execute("USE little_lemon")

```

### 5. Execute Join Query Example

This query retrieves booking and order details for orders with a bill amount greater than $60.

```sql
join_query = """
SELECT Bookings.BookingID, Bookings.TableNO, Bookings.GuestFirstName, Orders.BillAmount AS TotalCost
FROM Bookings
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Bookings.BookingID = Orders.BookingID
WHERE Orders.BillAmount > 60
"""
cursor.execute(join_query)
results = cursor.fetchall()
print(cursor.column_names)
print(results)

```
